This React.js application 'https://apirestaurantsearch.netlify.app/' is my first continuously intergrated and continuously deployed, via Netlify. Used an open source 3rd party API to render search functions by tapping in to 3 different keys - users can search by restaurant "location", "genre" (type of food), as well as "attire". 

API call method is Fetch, and I used React Bootstrap to color this simple app.
